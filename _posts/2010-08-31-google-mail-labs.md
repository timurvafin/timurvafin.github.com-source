title: Google mail labs I use every day

Let me share what crazy experimental stuff (Google calls labs stuff like this :-)) I use in my google apps mail on timurv.ru.

* Default "Reply to all" - Make "Reply to all" your default option for responding to emails.
* Mark as Read Button - Tired of spending all that effort to click on the More Actions menu every time you want to mark messages as read without reading them? Now just enable this label and that is just a button click away!
* Send & Archive - Adds a button to the compose form that lets you send a reply message and archive the email conversation in a single action.
* Sender Time Zone - Should I reply to this mail or just call the guy? Oops… it's 1 am. Sorry, I didn't mean to disturb…
* Title Tweaks - Changes order of elements in the browser title bar from "Timur Vafin Mail - Inbox (20) - me@timurv.ru" to "Inbox (20) - me@timurv.ru - Timur Vafin Mail". This way you are able (most of the time) to see if a new mail has arrived, even if Timur Vafin Mail window is minimised.
* Signature tweaks - Places your signature before the quoted text in a reply and removes the -- line that appears before signatures.

And can't wait when [Gmail Priority Inbox Sort](http://techcrunch.com/2010/08/30/gmail-priority-inbox/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader) will be released.
