In Flatsoft/Flatsourcing we looking for talented developers every day and usually 3-4 times per week we have interview with developers. They are Java/PHP developers which want to switch to the new technology like Ruby/Rails.

I can recommend some really stuff for learning Ruby, here they are:

* Check this quick tutorial: [Ruby in Twenty Minutes](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/quickstart/)
* Then try this one: Ruby by examples: [Ruby KOANS](http://rubykoans.com/)
* Read this: Ruby Bible: [PickAxe](http://pragprog.com/titles/ruby/programming-ruby)
* And read that: [very early draft](http://ruby.runpaint.org) of a book about version 1.9 of the Ruby with very good explanations of some tricky parts
* Join to your local Ruby/Rails user group or mailing list
* Join to some one open source Ruby project and try to commit bugfix/feature

**UPD:** Just read [this grate post](http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2010/8/28/rails-has-great-documentation) if  you interesting about how to learn Rails.
