title: RSS fead for Tumblr dashboard

Hey guys,

Going to use Tumblr as platform for my personal weblog around web technology and other tech themes.

So currently my <a href="http://timurv.ru" target="_blank">http://timurv.ru</a> hosted here on Thumblr. Interesting thing Thumblr have no RSS for dashboard but you can found a lot of code samples or services for getting RSS data over API, for example this one looks OK <a href="http://tumblr.immcdavis.com/post/397177701/tumblr-dashboard-rss-generator." target="_blank">http://tumblr.immcdavis.com/post/397177701/tumblr-dashboard-rss-generator.</a>


 > **But**: note - because of the way Tumblr’s authentication works, I have to save your password to be able to access your dashboard. If you’re worried about storing your password elsewhere, don’t use this.

Where is the code man? I prefer see what I use.
OK, for now I would like to find other ready solutions, (do you know others?), or write simple application hosted on heroku and public github repo.
What you think about it?
